==================================================================================================================
* Unit Testing : automated tests (usually functions) that are written to check if the src code is working as intended.
	- Results in either "pass" or "fail"

+ Unit testing ensures that the existing code functions normally, and can be used to validate whether the newly added
portion of the code is properly functioning or not, and is not affecting the existing code to malfunction.

* pytest : framework used for unit testing in Python

+ Essentially pytest is operated by running the command "pytest" on termial.
It will find the necessary tests by the way they have been named in the directory.
Files whose names start // end with  "test" are recognized as tests by the pytest library
